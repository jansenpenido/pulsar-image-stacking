# Pulsar Image Stacking
This application was developed as an exercise for Coursera's [Data-driven Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy) course.


## Overview
This repository contains Python code that calculates the mean and median stack of radio images. Such calculations are useful to detect signals of objects like pulsars in the presence of noise.

The images were captured by [Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)](http://www.mwatelescope.org/), a low-frequency radio telescope located in Western Australia. The images are available in the [FITS](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/) format.
